# QR CODE GENERATOR

## Features
- Accepts any text or URL input
- Saves the QR code as a PNG image
- Uses the `qrcode` Python library
- Uses the `tkinter` and `customtkinter` Python library
- Customizable filename
- It has GUI

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install the required library:
3. Run the script:
4. Enter the text or URL when prompted, then choose a filename. The QR code will be saved in the same folder.

## Files
- `qr_code_generator.py`: Main script
- `.gitignore`: Ignores the `venv/` folder
- `README.md`: You're reading it right now :D


## Why I built this
I wanted to create a simple, useful tool that shows Python can interact with external libraries and generate something visual. It's a great project for working with image generation and user input.
